# Vehicle-Tracking-System

To track the buses on the campus in real time and showcase it on a web app.

Initial try can be viewed here:- https://reuben27.github.io/Vehicle-Tracking-System/Tracker.html

## Working

- The Live-location.ino file determines the corrdinates using the gsm module. It then sends the coordinates to the thinkspeak database.

- The Tracker.js file displays the map with the current location of the bus using google maps javascript api. The marker gets updated everytime a new location is read.
